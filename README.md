Update OPEN VR virtual controller to version 1.0.6

It's an updated project based - https://github.com/hustcy/VirtualControllerDriver


This version also provides a shared memory method for controlling.

It's easy to write a simply UI with slider to control the pos & rot of the virtual controller at real time.


Make sure your steamvr component version is updated. I checked at 2017.03.29. Steam is OK, but Viveport is not supported yet.
